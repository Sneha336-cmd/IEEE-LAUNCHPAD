### About Me

I am currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, fueled by a deep enthusiasm for technology and programming.
I enjoy discovering innovative concepts, addressing practical challenges, and working alongside individuals who are equally motivated by creativity and making a difference.

I currently serve as the Vibe Officer of Events on the IEDC Executive Committee, where I play a key role in shaping, promoting, and implementing the organization's long-term vision and strategic objectives.
I collaborate closely with the Chief Visionary Officer and other executive leaders to ensure alignment of goals and to pinpoint opportunities for growth.
Through the coordination of events, team guidance, and the promotion of a collaborative culture, I have motivated individuals within the technology sector. 
My leadership style prioritizes teamwork.

Additionally, I aim to establish my own startup focused on a novel technological issue.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala boasts one of the most strategic, sustainable, and people-centric tech ecosystems in India.
It is characterized by a focus on talent rather than hype. 
The state generates a significant pool of skilled professionals, many of whom previously relocated elsewhere; however, an increasing number are now returning or opting to work remotely from Kerala, thanks to improved infrastructure and quality of life.

I have not yet had the chance to participate in open-source projects, but I am enthusiastic about beginning to explore this area.
